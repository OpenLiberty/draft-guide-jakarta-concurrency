NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

Learn how to run tasks parallelly or asynchronously in Java microservices by using Jakarta Concurrency APIs.

== What you'll learn

Jakarta Concurrency is a Java API specification of Jakarta EE that provides a framework for developing concurrent and asynchronous Java applications. The Jakarta Concurrency APIs provide concurrency utilities to make developers easier writing thread-safe and scalable applications to execute tasks parallelly or asynchronously and coordinate the completion of multiple asynchronous tasks in a more efficient manner. To learn more about Jakarta Concurrency, see the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/concurrency[Jakarta Concurrency specification^].


The application in this guide consists of two microservices, `system` and `inventory`. The `system` microservice provides GET REST APIs to retreive the Java system properties, heap size, memory usage, and system load. The `inventory` microservice provides different REST APIs to register systems, update their memory usage and system load, and query their information from the inventory.
// Also, the `inventory` microservice is scheduled for every 60 seconds to call the `system` microservice to update the memory usage and system load of the systems in the inventory.

You'll learn how to run tasks in parallel by implementing the POST `/api/inventory/system/{hostname}` endpoint that registers a system to the inventory, create asynchronous task by the PUT `/api/inventory/systems/memoryUsed` endpoint that updates the memory usage of the systems in the inventory, and synchronize asynchronous tasks by the PUT `/api/inventory/systems/systemLoad` endpoint that updates the system load of the systems.
// Then, you'll learn how to schedule a task to update the memory usage and system load of the systems for every 60 seconds.

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the application, navigate to the `finish` directory and run the following command to deploy the `system` microservice to Open Liberty:

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
[role="command"]
----
mvn -pl system liberty:run
----
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```bash
cd /home/project/guide-concurrency-intro/finish
mvn -pl system liberty:run
```
endif::[]

Open another command-line session. Navigate to the `finish` directory and run the following command to deploy the `inventory` service to Open Liberty:

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
[role="command"]
----
mvn -pl inventory liberty:run
----
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```bash
cd /home/project/guide-concurrency-intro/finish
mvn -pl inventory liberty:run
```
endif::[]

When you see the following message in both command-line sessions, both your services are ready.

[role="no_copy"]
----
The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet.
----

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
Visit the http://localhost:9081/openapi/ui URL to try out the REST endpoints of the `inventory` microservice.

First, make a POST request to the `/api/inventory/system/{hostname}` endpoint. To make this request, expand the POST endpoint on the UI, click the `Try it out` button, provide  `localhost` for the `hostname` parameter, then click the `Execute` button. The POST request registers the `localhost` system to the inventory.

Visit the http://localhost:9081/api/inventory/systems URL to see the inventory. You will see an output similar to the following:

[role="no_copy"]
----
[
  {
    "heapSize": 8589934592,
    "hostname": "localhost",
    "javaVersion": "17.0.12",
    "memoryUsage": 0,
    "osName": "Mac OS X",
    "systemLoad": 0
  }
]
----

Repeat the above POST endpoint for the `hostname` parameter with the value of `127.0.0.1` and your local system hostname.

Then, make a PUT request to the `/api/inventory/systems/memoryUsed` endpoint with `5` seconds for the `after` parameter and a PUT request to the `/api/inventory/systems/systemLoad` endpoint with `5` seconds for the `after` parameter. After 5 seconds, visit the http://localhost:9081/api/inventory/systems URL again to see that the `memoryUsage` and `systemLoad` values are updated to non-zero. If you interest, try out the other endpoints.
endif::[]


ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
Try out the REST endpoints of the `inventory` microservice.

First, make a POST request to the `/api/inventory/system/{hostname}` endpoint to register the `localhost` system to the inventory by runnning the following command:

```bash
curl -X POST  http://localhost:9081/api/inventory/system/localhost
```

Make a GET request to the `/api/inventory/systems` endpoint to see the inventory.

```bash
curl http://localhost:9081/api/inventory/systems | jq
```

You will see an output similar to the following:

```
[
  {
    "heapSize": 8589934592,
    "hostname": "localhost",
    "javaVersion": "17.0.12",
    "memoryUsage": 0,
    "osName": "Mac OS X",
    "systemLoad": 0
  }
]
```

Repeat the above POST endpoint with the value of `127.0.0.1` and the local system hostname by the following commands:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9081/api/inventory/system/127.0.0.1
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9081/api/inventory/system/`hostname`
```

Then, make a PUT request to the `/api/inventory/systems/memoryUsed` endpoint and the `/api/inventory/systems/systemLoad` endpoints by the following commands:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9081/api/inventory/systems/memoryUsed?after=5
```

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9081/api/inventory/systems/systemLoad?after=5
```

After 5 seconds, visit the `/api/inventory/systems` endpoint again to see that the `memoryUsage` and `systemLoad` values are updated to non-zero by the following command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9081/api/inventory/systems | jq
```
endif::[]

After you are finished checking out the application, stop the Liberty instance by pressing `CTRL+C` in the command-line session where you ran the `inventory` services. Alternatively, you can run the `liberty:stop` goal from the `finish` directory in another command-line session:

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
[role="command"]
----
mvn -pl inventory liberty:stop
----
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```bash
cd /home/project/guide-concurrency-intro/finish
mvn -pl inventory liberty:stop
```
endif::[]

Let the `system` microservice running. In the following sections, you'll implement the `inventory` microservice to learn how to create parallel or asynchronous tasks.

== Running tasks in parallel

// static guide instructions:
ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.
endif::[]

// cloud-hosted guide instructions:
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
To begin, run the following command to navigate to the ***start*** directory:
```bash
cd /home/project/guide-concurrency-intrp/start
```
endif::[]

When you run Open Liberty in https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/development-mode.html[dev mode^], dev mode listens for file changes and automatically recompiles and deploys your updates whenever you save a new change.

Run the following goal to start the `inventory` microservice in dev mode:

[role='command']
----
mvn -pl inventory liberty:dev
----

When you see the following message, your Liberty instance is ready in dev mode:

[role="no_copy"]
----
**************************************************************
*    Liberty is running in dev mode.
----

Dev mode holds your command-line session to listen for file changes. Open another command-line session to continue, or open the project in your editor.

The https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/concurrent-3.0.html[Jakarta Concurrency^] feature has already been enabled for you in the Liberty [hotspot=concurrent file=0]`server.xml` configuration file.

In this section, you will learn how to implement a task that calls the `system` microservice in parallel to get different system data.

InventoryAsyncTask.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright,updateSystemsUsage,asynchronous1,updateSystemsMemoryUsed,asynchronous2,getSystemLoad']
----
include::finish/inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryAsyncTask.java[]
----

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `InventoryAsyncTask.java` file.#
`inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryAsyncTask.java`
----

This bean provides different utilities for the `inventory` service. Annotating the [hotspot=managedExecutor file=1]`managedExecutor` field with the [hotspot=managedExecutor file=1]`@Resource` annotation, an instance of the `ManagedScheduledExecutorService` requested resource will be injected when the bean is initialized by Liberty runtime.

The [hotspot=getClientData file=1]`getClientData()` method uses the [hotspot=submit1 hotspot=submit2 hotspot=submit3 file=1]`managedExecutor` to submit multiple tasks in parallel. Each task uses the [hotspot=getSystemClient1 hotspot=getSystemClient2 hotspot=getSystemClient3 hotspot=getSystemClientMethod file=1]`getSystemClient()` method to get the REST client for the given system hostname, and use the client to retieve the [hotspot=osName hotspot=javaVer hotspot=heapSize file=1]`os.name` property, [hotspot=osName hotspot=javaVer hotspot=heapSize file=1]`java.version` property, and the [hotspot=osName hotspot=javaVer hotspot=heapSize file=1]`heap size` of the system.

The [hotspot=submitTask1 hotspot=submitTask2 hotspot=submitTask3 file=1]`submit()` tasks run in parallel and return [hotspot=submit1 hotspot=submit2 hotspot=submit3 file=1]`Future<>` object immediatedly for the result of asynchronous task. Use the [hotspot=get file=1]`get()` method to wait the task completion, and then retrieves the result.

Implement the POST `/api/inventory/system/{hostname}` endpoint of the `inventory` microservice to register a system to the inventory.

InventoryResource.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright,updateMemoryUsed,updateSystemLoad']
----
include::finish/inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java[]

[role="code_command hotspot file=2", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `InventoryResource.java` file.#
`inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java`
----

Inject the [hotspot=inventoryAsyncTask file=2]`InventoryAsyncTask` bean into the `InventoryResource` class. Create the POST [hotspot=addSystemClient file=2]`/system/{hostname}` endpoint that uses the bean's [hotspot=getClientData file=2]`getClientData()` method to collect the properties from the `system` microservice and addes the system into the inventory.

You started the Open Liberty in dev mode at the beginning of the this section, so all the changes were automatically picked up.

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
Visit the http://localhost:9081/openapi/ui URL and make a POST request to the `/api/inventory/system/{hostname}` endpoint with the value of `localhost`. Then, visit the http://localhost:9081/api/inventory/systems URL to see the inventory. You will see an output similar to the following:

[role="no_copy"]
----
[
  {
    "heapSize": 8589934592,
    "hostname": "localhost",
    "javaVersion": "17.0.12",
    "memoryUsage": 0,
    "osName": "Mac OS X",
    "systemLoad": 0
  }
]
----

Repeat the above POST endpoint for the `hostname` parameter with the value of `127.0.0.1` and your local system hostname.
endif::[]


ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
Make a POST request to the `/api/inventory/system/{hostname}` endpoint to register the `localhost` system to the inventory by runnning the following command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9081/api/inventory/system/localhost
```

Make a GET request to the `/api/inventory/systems` endpoint to see the inventory.

```bash
curl http://localhost:9081/api/inventory/systems | jq
```

You will see an output similar to the following:

```
[
  {
    "heapSize": 8589934592,
    "hostname": "localhost",
    "javaVersion": "17.0.12",
    "memoryUsage": 0,
    "osName": "Mac OS X",
    "systemLoad": 0
  }
]
```

Repeat the above POST endpoint with the value of `127.0.0.1` and the local system hostname by the following commands:

```bash
curl -X POST  http://localhost:9081/api/inventory/system/127.0.0.1
```

```bash
curl -X POST  http://localhost:9081/api/inventory/system/`hostname`
```
endif::[]

== Creating asynchronous task

In this section, you will learn how to implement an asynchronous task to update the memory usage of the systems in the inventory.

InventoryAsyncTask.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright,updateSystemsUsage,asynchronous2,getSystemLoad']
----
include::finish/inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryAsyncTask.java[]
----

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `InventoryAsyncTask.java` file.#
`inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryAsyncTask.java`
----

The [hotspot=updateSystemsMemoryUsed file=0]`updateSystemsMemoryUsed()` method uses the [hotspot=systems hotspot=schedule file=0]`managedExecutor` to schedule multiple tasks that will be delayed with the given [hotspot=parameters hotspot=after file=0]`after` seconds and executed in parallel. Each task calls the client's [hotspot=getMemoryUsed file=0]`getMemoryUsed()` method to retieve the memory usage, and calls the system's [hotspot=setMemoryUsed file=0]`setMemoryUsed()` method to calculate the memory usage.

Annotate the [hotspot=asynchronous1 file=0]`updateSystemsMemoryUsed()` method with the `@Asynchronous` annotation to make it running asynchronously.

InventoryResource.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright,updateSystemLoad']
----
include::finish/inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java[]
----

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `InventoryResource.java` file.#
`inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java`
----

Create the PUT [hotspot=updateMemoryUsed file=1]`/systems/memoryUsed` endpoint that uses the [hotspot=inventoryAsyncTask file=1]`task` bean's [hotspot=updateSystemsMemoryUsed file=1]`updateSystemsMemoryUsed()` method to update the memory usage of all systems in the inventory and returns immediately.

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
Visit the http://localhost:9081/openapi/ui URL and make a PUT request to the `/api/inventory/systems/memoryUsed` endpoint with `5` seconds for the `after` parameter. After 5 seconds, visit the http://localhost:9081/api/inventory/systems URL to see that the `memoryUsage` values are updated to non-zero.
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
Make a PUT request to the `/api/inventory/systems/memoryUsed` endpoint by the following command:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9081/api/inventory/systems/memoryUsed?after=5
```

After 5 seconds, visit the `/api/inventory/systems` endpoint again to see that the `memoryUsage` values are updated to non-zero by the following command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9081/api/inventory/systems | jq
```
endif::[]

== Synchronizing asynchronous tasks

In this section, you will learn how to synchronize asynchronous tasks to update the system load of the systems in the inventory.

InventoryAsyncTask.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright,updateSystemsUsage']
----
include::finish/inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryAsyncTask.java[]
----

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `InventoryAsyncTask.java` file.#
`inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryAsyncTask.java`
----
The [hotspot=getSystemLoad file=0]`getSystemLoad()` method calls the client's [hotspot=clientGetSystemLoad file=0]`getSystemLoad()` method to retieve the system load, and returns the system load in [hotspot=getSystemLoadSignature file=0]`CompletableFuture<Double>` type by using the [hotspot=return file=0]`Asynchronous.Result.complete()` method.

Annotate the [hotspot=asynchronous2 file=0]`getSystemLoad()` method with the `@Asynchronous` annotation to make it running asynchronously.

InventoryResource.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java[]
----

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `InventoryResource.java` file.#
`inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java`
----

Create the PUT [hotspot=updateSystemLoad file=1]`/systems/systemLoad` endpoint that multiply calls the [hotspot=inventoryAsyncTask file=1]`task` bean's [hotspot=getSystemLoad file=1]`getSystemLoad()` method to retrieve the system load of all systems in the inventory. When the calls return, the [hotspot=thenAcceptAsync file=1]`thenAcceptAsync()` method processes the returned data with the `CompletableFuture<Double>` type and calls the system's [hotspot=setSystemLoad file=1]`setSystemLoad()` method to store the system load. Exceptions are handled in a callback that is provided to the [hotspot=exceptionally file=1]`exceptionally()` method, which behaves like a catch block. 

A [hotspot=countDownLatch file=1]`CountDownLatch` object is used to track asynchronous requests. The [hotspot=countDown1 hotspot=countDown2 file=1]`countDown()` method is called whenever a request is complete. When the [hotspot=countDownLatch hotspot=countDown1 hotspot=countDown2 file=1]`CountDownLatch` is at zero, it indicates that all asynchronous requests are complete. By using the [hotspot=await file=1]`await()` method of the `CountDownLatch`, the program waits for all the asynchronous requests to be complete. When all asynchronous requests are complete, the program resumes execution with all required data processed.

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
Visit the http://localhost:9081/openapi/ui URL and make a PUT request to the `/api/inventory/systems/systemLoad` endpoint with `5` seconds for the `after` parameter. The request will take 5 seconds to complete. Visit the http://localhost:9081/api/inventory/systems URL to see that the `systemLoad` values are updated to non-zero.
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
Make a PUT request to the `/api/inventory/systems/systemLoad` endpoint by the following command:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9081/api/inventory/systems/systemLoad?after=5
```

The request will take 5 seconds to complete.

Visit the `/api/inventory/systems` endpoint to see that the `systemLoad` values are updated to non-zero by the following command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9081/api/inventory/systems | jq
```
endif::[]


//== Scheduling asynchronous task
//This section will be available when Liberty supports concurrency-3.1 (now is in beta)
//
//* Replace the InventoryAsyncTask
//  * Create a scheduling method that updates the memory usage and system load of all systems in every 20 seconds

== Testing the inventory application

Although you can test your application manually, automated tests ensure consistent code quality by triggering a failure whenever a code change introduces a defect. In this section, you’ll create integration tests for the `inventory` microservice.

Create a RESTful client interface for the `inventory` microservice.

InventoryResourceClient.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/inventory/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResourceClient.java[]
----

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `InventoryResourceClient.java` file.#
`inventory/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResourceClient.java`
----

This interface declares [hotspot=listContents file=0]`listContents()`, [hotspot=getSystem file=0]`getSystem()`, [hotspot=addSystemClient file=0]`addSystemClient()`, [hotspot=updateMemoryUsed file=0]`updateMemoryUsed()`, [hotspot=updateSystemLoad file=0]`updateSystemLoad()`, [hotspot=removeSystem file=0]`removeSystem()`, and [hotspot=resetSystems file=0]`resetSystems()` methods for accessing each of the endpoints that are set up to access the `inventory` microservice.

InventoryEndpointIT.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/inventory/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryEndpointIT.java[]

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `InventoryEndpointIT.java` file.#
`inventory/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryEndpointIT.java`
----

The [hotspot=testAddSystems file=1]`testAddSystems()` tests the POST `/inventory/system/{hostname}` endpoint and confirms that three systems are added to the inventory.

The [hotspot=testUpdateMemoryUsed file=1]`testUpdateMemoryUsed()` tests the PUT `/inventory/systems/memoryUsed` endpoint and confirms that the memory usage of each system is greater than 0.0.

The [hotspot=testUpdateSystemLoad file=1]`testUpdateSystemLoad()` tests the PUT `/inventory/systems/systemLoad` endpoint and confirms that the system load of each system is greater than 0.0.

The [hotspot=testResetSystems file=1]`testResetSystems()` tests the PUT `/inventory/systems/reset` endpoint and confirms that the memory usage and the system load of each system are 0.0.

The [hotspot=testRemoveSystem file=1]`testRemoveSystem()` tests the DELETE `/inventory/systems/{hostname}` endpoint and confirms that two systems remain in the inventory.

=== Running the tests

Because you started Open Liberty in dev mode, you can run the tests by pressing the `enter/return` key from the command-line session where you started the `inventory` microservice.

If the tests pass, you see a similar output to the following example:

[source, role='no_copy']
----
-------------------------------------------------------

Results:

Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
----

When you are done checking out the services, exit dev mode by pressing `CTRL+C` in the command-line sessions where you ran the `system` and `inventory` microservices.

== Great work! You're done!

You just developed tasks that run parallelly or asynchronously in a Java microservice by using Jakarta Concurrency APIs in Open Liberty.
